# Richard Polisuk . Jarvis Consulting

I am an experienced information technology professional with systems, network, and infrastructure architecture experience. I am currently pursuing software engineering opportunities. I have extensive professional experience with IBM Canada, CIBC, and TELUS. While at IBM Canada, I worked as a mainframe software developer, was part of the Internet services team, and eventually worked with CIBC in developing their first web based banking solution. I continued working on this project once I joined CIBC and then was the Chief Architect for the CIBC VeriSign PKI product. I was involved in running, installing, configuring, and supporting the CIBC VeriSign secure datacenter environment. At TELUS Health (which was called BCE Emergis and then Emergis), I was an infrastructure Architect working in datacenter projects helping to bring products into the production environment. As well I supported the development network including switches, routers, and Load Balancers and worked on migrating this environment to a VMWare NSX virtual networking environment. My final role at TELUS was part of the TELUS Health team that was building a new AWS environment where I helped to administer many different DevOps tools. I have a Bachelor of Commerce degree with a major in Management Information Systems from McGill University and I received an Ontario College Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis from Seneca College. While at Seneca College I learned software development and gained experience in many different programming languages, web development, networking, database systems, Big Data, and mobile development. In the future I hope to leverage all my experience to be a software developer or a DevOps developer.
